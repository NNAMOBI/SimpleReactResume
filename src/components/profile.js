            <p>Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and everything in its orbit.
                I recently began to be fascinated by web programming, e.g. developing apps and building websites.
       As this area complements my first degree in Civil Engineering, I am keen to gain more experience in the IT field. <br />
        For this reason, I am looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among their developers.
                 In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and friendly addition to your team.
I am therefore currently looking for a job or an internship as a FullStack developer.</p>
